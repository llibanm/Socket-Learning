Here are my training on how to create socket, selectors and making a broadcast transfert to workers that will connect to a Master handling the selector.
This work is made during my internship at LIAS laboratory in ISAE-ESMA engineering school as part of my internship project on Distributed data system.

You must first start the server with MasterNIO then launch the worker using LaunchWorker.
